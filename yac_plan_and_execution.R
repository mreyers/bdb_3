# Skill / Value Estimation part 3
  # Recovery model in terms of limiting yards / value after the catch

# This model may well be simple, just extending the SIS work to handle the idea
# Doing so would involve estimating YAC, either by reproducing nflfastR model or
# by pivoting thesis work over.

# TODO:
  # 1. Decide on YAC approach
  # 2. Calculate YACOE given the base model
  # 3. Estimate additional EPA gained between Observed and Expected YAC
  # 4. Append these values to our current setup
  # 5. Having completed all 3 models, find a way to appropriately combine the evaluation schemes
