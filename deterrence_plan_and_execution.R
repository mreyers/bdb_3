# Skill / Value Estimation part 2
  # Deterrence model as measured by hypothetical CP throughout the frames of the play

# Deterrence we have a lot less information for but
# fortunately will be able to pull heavily from influence.

# TODO:
  # 1. Formalize concept of deterrence and how it relates to defence
    # a) Explore CP as a function to minimize
    # b) Explore Hypothetical EPA as a function to minimize
  # 2. Pull in the CP model-enhanced data set
  # 3. Pull in a new CP model in which no influence data is used
  # 4. Compare framewise completion probabilities for the influence based output and the influence indep output
  # 5. Assess team / scheme level capabilities 


# Complete:
